<div style="font-size:50px; text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Planning for Anycast as Anti-DDoS</div>

<!-- The PAADDoS project’s goal is to defend against large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks by making anycast-based capacity more effective than it is today. Anycast use Internet routing to associate users with geographically close sites of a replicated service. During DDoS, anycast sites can provide capacity to absorb an attack, and they can be used to isolate the attack to part of the network. -->

<!-- We will work toward our goal of improving anycast use during DDoS by (1) developing tools to map anycast catchments and baseline load, (2) develop methods to plan changes and their effects on catchments, and (3) develop tools to estimate attack load and assist anycast reconfiguration during an attack. -->

The PAADDoS project’s goal is to investigate how to improve anycast networks to better support DDoS mitigation by understanding current services, and boosting design, routing control, management and coverage by collaboration. Anycast use Internet routing to associate users with geographically close sites of a replicated service. During DDoS, anycast sites can provide capacity to absorb an attack, and they can be used to isolate the attack to part of the network. 

We will work toward our goal of improving anycast use during DDoS by answering some research questions:
* **RQ1:** Which requirements are needed to build a shared anycast defense against DDoS ?
* **RQ2:** Which aspects of anycast design should be considered on DDoS mitigation ?
* **RQ3**: What are the best spots in the Internet to deploy an anycast network for DDoS mitigation?
* **RQ4**: How to better exploit anycast routing to fight DDoS attacks ?
* **RQ5:** How to enable operators/administrators/players to manage anycast networks on a shared infrastructure ?

We expect these innovations to improve service resilience in the face of DDoS attacks. Our tools will improve anycast agility and management during an attack, allowing capacity to be used effectively.
