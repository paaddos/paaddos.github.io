### Our paper "Forecasting the Impact of IXP Outages Using Anycast" was accepted on TMA2021 [IFIP/TC6 Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference](https://tma.ifip.org/2021/)

Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) play a major role in Internet connectivity. They provide an infrastructure for traffic exchange, attracting Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and cloud providers, leading to a plethora of options for network operators to connect. Alongside, policymakers are interested in understanding how failures of these infrastructures could affect the cyber economy. In this paper, we propose a new method based on anycast to assess the importance of IXPs in terms of coverage and regional representativeness with the goal of predicting the impact of IXP failures. We deployed an anycast infrastructure to connect to major IXPs, simulate outages, and map the impact of such failures. Our experiments show that our methodology can predict how the traffic flows when one IXP goes down, helping operators get prepared to deal with these events, and add more information to better assess the importance of IXPs as critical infrastructure.
