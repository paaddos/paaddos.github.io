title: New project “Plannning for Anycast as Anti-DDoS” (PAADDoS)

### We are happy to announce a new project Plannning for Anycast as Anti-DDoS (PAADDoS).

The PAADDoS project’s goal is to defend against large-scale DDoS attacks by making anycast-based capacity more effective than it is today.

We will work toward this goal by (1) developing tools to map anycast catchments and baseline load, (2) develop methods to plan changes and their effects on catchments, (3) develop tools to estimate attack load and assist anycast reconfiguration during an attack. and (4) evaluate and integration of these tools with traditional DoS defenses.

We expect these innovations to improve service resilience in the face of DDoS attacks. Our tools will improve anycast agility during an attack, allowing capacity to be used effectively.

PAADDoS is a joint effort of the [ANT Lab](https://ant.isi.edu) involving [USC/ISI](https://www.isi.edu) (PI: [John Heidemann](https://www.isi.edu/~johnh/)) and the [Design and Analysis of Communication Systems group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/dacs/)  at the University of Twente (PI: [Aiko Pras](https://people.utwente.nl/a.pras)).

PAADDoS is supported by the [DHS HSARPA Cyber Security Division](https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/cybersecurity-programs) via contract number HSHQDC-17-R-B0004-TTA.02-0006-I, and by [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl).
