The paper "Tangled: A Cooperative Anycast Testbed" has been awarded as the best paper of IM 2021 Experience Session [IFIP/IEEE International Symposium on Integrated Network Management]

Abstract: 
Anycast routing has attracted interest in recent years as a technology for CDNs and anti-DDoS services. Most anycast studies conducted in the past relied on coarse measurement data, or are subjected to the collaboration of a global player affecting the experiment flexibility. In this paper, we present Tangled, an anycast testbed where researchers can run experiments and better understand the impacts of their proposals on a global infrastructure. We also share our hand-on experience validating transit providers routing configurations. Our testbed offers a flexible and complete testing environment to evaluate the routing behavior of anycast networks in the wild. We provided tools that allow users to customize and reconfigure the anycast network, perform experiments, do active measurements, and collect data by using a platform specially designed for. The deployed infrastructure was designed to create industry and academy cooperation. Tangled enables researchers to answer your research questions while allows transit providers to validate the implementation of complex routing agreements.
