## Anti-DDoS Workshop join US-NL researcher teams 

#### [Anti-DDoS Workshop on October 24th which is organized by NWO, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the University of Twente and hosted by dcypher](https://www.dcypher.nl/en/international-collaboration-against-ddos-attacks)

The program was filled in by the joint US-NL research teams and invited scientist working on anti-DDoS. The Anti-DDoS Workshop on October 24th which is organized by NWO, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the University of Twente and hosted by dcypher. 

Principal Investigators of each project presented the current state of their running projects through a formal presentation in an informal setting, with the focus on the exchange of knowledge and experience in this international collaboration.

The third NWO/NCSC/DHS project presented during the workshop was the PAADDoS project by Aiko Pras from the University of Twente and John Heidemann from the University of Southern California. Their research focuses on so-called anycast systems as a defence mechanism. In an anycast network, multiple servers at multiple locations represent the same IP address. If a certain IP address is targeted by a DDoS attack, in an anycast network only those servers that are closest to the attacker will be bothered by it, and the service will remain accessible because the traffic is being rerouted through others servers. ‘We use a tool called Verfploeter to map out how information is currently routed over the internet,’ Heidemann said. ‘Remarkably enough, traffic still very often travel through places where it has no business of being. For example, it is quite a challenge to keep European internet traffic within Europe.’
